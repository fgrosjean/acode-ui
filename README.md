# Acode
### Xcode inspired theme for Atom.
#### Feels just like it should.


## Description
Acode brings the native look and feel and the ease of use of macOS to Atom. This UI theme adheres the closest it can to the current [Apple Human Interface guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/), it's a major redesign of the entire Atom interface that gives you a more polished and improved experience. It has support for high-resolution displays (retina), [a color scheme](https://github.com/fgrosjean/acode-syntax), native tab behavior, a custom set of file type icons... and a lot more!
