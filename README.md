# Xcode inspired theme for Atom.

Acode brings the native look and feel and the easy-to-use visual language of macOS to Atom.
This UI theme adheres the closest it can to the current [Apple Human Interface guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/), a major redesign of the entire Atom interface that gives you a more polished and improved experience.
It has support for high-resolution displays (retina), a color scheme, native tab behavior, a custom set of file type icons... and a lot more!
